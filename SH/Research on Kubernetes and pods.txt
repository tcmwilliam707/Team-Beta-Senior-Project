Kubernetes uses pods, a form of container.
Kubernetes allows you to have desired state management, allowing you
to run a specific configuration. 
The Kubernetes API sits in front of the Kubernetes cluster service.
In Kubernetes have workers attached to containers that attaches to 
the Kubernetes cluster service.
The pod configuration is managed by the .yaml file, that describes
what goes into a pod, container and the desired state.
There are pods, and also replicas of pods.
