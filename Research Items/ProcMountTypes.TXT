Definition of /proc in linux:
-The /proc directory contains virtual files that are windows into the current state of the running Linux kernel. This allows the 
user to peer into a vast array of information, effectively providing them with the kernel's point-of-view within the system. In addition,
the user can use the /proc directory to communicate particular configuration changes to the kernel.

Mounting in Linux:
On all Unix systems, every file and every directory is part of one big file tree. To access a file, you need to know the full path 
starting from the root directory. When adding a file system to your computer, you need to make it available somewhere in the file tree. 
The directory where you make a file system available is called a mount point.

ProcMounting is essentially mounting the /proc directory for easy access to display information in the eyes of the Linux Kernal.


ProcMountingTypes in Kubernetes:
allowedProcMountTypes is a list of allowed ProcMountTypes. Empty or nil indicates that only the DefaultProcMountType may be used.

DefaultProcMount: uses the container runtime defaults for read-only and masked paths for /proc. Most container runtimes mask certain 
paths in /proc to avoid accidental security exposure of special devices or information. This is denoted as the string Default.

The only other ProcMountType is UnmaskedProcMount, which bypasses the default masking behavior of the container runtime and ensures 
the newly created /proc the container stays intact with no modifications. (String Unmasked)


Why use ProcMounting?:
-To run unprivileged containers using user namespaces nested inside CRI containers, we need an option to have a ProcMount. That is, 
we need an option to designate explicitly turn off masking and setting read-only of paths so that we can mount /proc in the nested 
container as an unprivileged user.
