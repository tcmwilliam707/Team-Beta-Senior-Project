Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota).

In future versions of Kubernetes, objects in the same namespace will have the same access control policies by default.

Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. 
Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

When you create a Service, it creates a corresponding DNS entry. This entry is of the form <service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local, which means that if a container just uses <service-name>, it will resolve to the service which is local to a namespace. 
This is useful for using the same configuration across multiple namespaces such as Development, Staging and Production. If you want to reach across namespaces, you need to use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
