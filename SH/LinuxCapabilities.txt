Linux capabilities provide a finer grained breakdown of the privileges traditionally associated with the superuser such as a privileged container. 
Can be used to escalate privileges and may be restricted to the PodSecurtiyPolicy. Priviledged containers allow most of these capabilites.

List of Capability Fields:
AllowedCapabilites- Provides list of capabilities that are allowed to be added to a container.
RequiredCapabilities- Capabilites that must be dropped for a container (Must no be included in AllowedCapabilites or DefaultAddCapabilites).
DefaultAddCapabilities- Capabilites added to a container by default. 
Default list can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities
