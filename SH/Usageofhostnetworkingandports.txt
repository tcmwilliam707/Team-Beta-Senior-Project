important port numbers:

Http: 80
File transfer protocal: 20
We use port numbers to host our containers on a website.
Websites have multiple ports, but security process allow us to only display a port
such a https

Host namespaces
HostPID - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host process ID namespace. 
Note that when paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside 
of the container (ptrace is forbidden by default).

HostIPC - Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace.

HostNetwork - Controls whether the pod may use the node network namespace. 
Doing so gives the pod access to the loopback device, services listening 
on localhost, and could be used to snoop on network activity of other 
pods on the same node.

HostPorts - Provides a list of ranges of allowable ports in the host 
network namespace. Defined as a list of HostPortRange, with 
min(inclusive) and max(inclusive). Defaults to no allowed host ports.
