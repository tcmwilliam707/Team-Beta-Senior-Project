FlexVolume is an out-of-tree plugin interface that has existed in Kubernetes since version 1.2 (before CSI). It uses an exec-based model to interface with drivers. 
FlexVolume driver binaries must be installed in a pre-defined volume plugin path on each node (and in some cases master).

Pods interact with FlexVolume drivers through the flexvolume in-tree plugin.

Flexvolume enables users to write their own drivers and add support for their volumes in Kubernetes. 
Vendor drivers should be installed in the volume plugin path on every node, and on master if the driver requires attach capability 
(unless --enable-controller-attach-detach Kubelet option is set to false, but this is highly discouraged because it is a legacy mode of operation).

Flexvolume is a GA feature from Kubernetes 1.8 release onwards.

A great recorse.
