Host File is a file to manage a table of computer names and IP addresses.
The host file performs a name to IP address mapping.
A host file is used when you enter a network name into an internet browser.
Host files are not used often in modern websites, however it is useful for network testing
and web development. You can use these to prepare to be using a website url without it being
live.

AllowedHostPaths - This specifies a list of host paths that are allowed to be used by 
hostPath volumes. An empty list means there is no restriction on host paths used. 
This is defined as a list of objects with a single pathPrefix field, which allows 
hostPath volumes to mount a path that begins with an allowed prefix, and a readOnly field 
indicating it must be mounted read-only. For example:


	allowedHostPaths:
  	  # This allows "/foo", "/foo/", "/foo/bar" etc., but
  	  # disallows "/fool", "/etc/foo" etc.
  	  # "/foo/../" is never valid.
  	  - pathPrefix: "/foo"
    	    readOnly: true # only allow read-only mounts
